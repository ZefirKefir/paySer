One of the oldest projects of mine, I wouldn't even ask to rate this any possible way, but it is the part of history for me.
The biggest project I've made way long ago with HTML/CSS/JS vanilla.
You can find bunch of incorrect ways to do anything in this reprositorium, so don't mind.

Actually, this was supposed to be a working online wallet, but the customer and backender couldn't agree with each other and project was sent to the trash.
